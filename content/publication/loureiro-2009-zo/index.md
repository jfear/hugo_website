abstract: "In this study, we tested the role of colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) as one of the regulatory molecules that mediate maternal effects on embryonic development during the preimplantation period. Our objective was to verify effects of CSF2 on blastocyst yield, determine posttransfer survival, and evaluate properties of the blastocyst formed after CSF2 treatment. In vitro, CSF2 increased the percentage of oocytes that became morulae and blastocysts. Blastocysts that were treated with CSF2 tended to have a greater number of inner cell mass cells and had a higher ratio of inner cell mass to trophectoderm cells. There was no effect of CSF2 on the incidence of apoptosis. Treatment with CSF2 from d 5 to 7 after insemination increased embryonic survival as indicated by improved pregnancy rate at d 30-35 of gestation. Moreover, treatment with CSF2 from either d 1-7 or 5-7 after insemination reduced pregnancy loss after d 30-35. Results indicate that treatment with CSF2 can affect embryonic development and enhance embryo competence for posttransfer survival. The fact that treatment with CSF2 during such a narrow window of development altered embryonic function much later in pregnancy suggests that CSF2 may exert epigenetic effects on the developing embryo that result in persistent changes in function during the embryonic and fetal periods of development."
