abstract: "Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) describe regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. Computational methods to infer GRNs typically combine evidence across different conditions to infer context-agnostic networks. We develop a method, Network Reprogramming using EXpression (NetREX), that constructs a context-specific GRN given context-specific expression data and a context-agnostic prior network. NetREX remodels the prior network to obtain the topology that provides the best explanation for expression data. Because NetREX utilizes prior network topology, we also develop PriorBoost, a method that evaluates a prior network in terms of its consistency with the expression data. We validate NetREX and PriorBoost using the ``gold standard'' E. coli GRN from the DREAM5 network inference challenge and apply them to construct sex-specific Drosophila GRNs. NetREX constructed sex-specific Drosophila GRNs that, on all applied measures, outperform networks obtained from other methods indicating that NetREX is an important milestone toward building more accurate GRNs."
